I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) at [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Feng Qian](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~fengqian/). I also work closely with [Prof. Bo Han](https://cs.gmu.edu/~bohan/). My research interests include Networked System, Mobile Computing, VR/AR/MR. Before coming to USC, I spent the first four years of my Ph.D. at [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMN)](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I got my bachelor degree from [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing in 2019.
